## What is Conditional Probability?

-   If probability is a measure of uncertainty, conditional probabilty explitly addresses how new data affects our level of uncertainty.

### Rain example:
- Let *P(R)* indicates the probability of rain before looking outside. If after looking outside we see ominous clouds, we might adjust our expectation of rain, given how cloudy it is. 

- We can denote this new probability as *P(R|C)*, or the probability of *R* (rain) given *C* (clouds). This is called "conditioning on C."
