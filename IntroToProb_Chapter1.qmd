## Counting Review

<br>

[Sampling Table]{style="color: orange;"}

![](SamplingTable.png){width="300"}

<br>

The [above formulae](https://youtu.be/KbB0FjPg0mw?t=2525) can be used to estimate the number of possible outcomes or permutations depending on the experimental conditions.

<br>

[**Unordered with replacement is a special case that often violates the naive assumption of probability. Use with caution.**]{style="color: orange;"}

## Combinatorics Review: n Choose k

[**The Binomial Coefficient**]{style="color: orange;"} counts the number of ways to choose $k$ objects from $n$, without replacement, where order does not matter:

<br>

$$\displaystyle C(n,k) =  {}_{n}C_k = \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!} = \frac{n(n-1)...(n-k+1)}{k!}$$

<br>

[*Remember, this calculation assumes that **order matters**, and that each object* $k$ is unique.]{style="color: orange;"}

## Some identities of note:

1)  $$\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}$$

<br>

2)  $$n\binom{n-1}{k-1} = k\binom{n}{k} $$

<br>

3)  [Vandermonde identity](https://youtu.be/FJd_1H3rZGg?t=2300): $$\binom{m+n}{k} = \displaystyle \sum_{j=0}^{k}\binom{m}{j}\binom{n}{k-j}$$


## Combinatorics Example: What is the probability that the total after rolling 4 fair dice is 21?

::: {.incremental}
- [To get a 21, the outcome must be a permutation of $(6,6,6,3)$, $(6,6,5,4)$, or $(6,5,5,5)$. How many possible arrangements exist that achieve each of these combinations?]{style="color: orange;"}

  +   For $(6,6,6,3)$, we have $n=4$ dice and we are essentially just choosing which $k=1$ to be equal to $3$. Thus, ${}_{4}C_1 = \frac{4!}{(4-1)!1!} = \frac{4*3!}{3!} = 4$

  +   For $(6,6,5,4)$, we are choosing which $k=2$ dice to be some combination of $5$ and $4$. ${}_{4}C_2 = \frac{4!}{(4-2)!1!} = \frac{4*3*2!}{2!} = 12$

  +   For $(6,5,5,5)$, we are choosing which $k=1$ die to be equal to $6$. ${}_{4}C_1 = \frac{4!}{(4-1)!1!} = \frac{4*3!}{3!} = 4$

- Therefore, there are a total of $\binom{4}{1} + \binom{4}{1} + \binom{4}{2} = 4 + 4 + 12 = 20$ favorable outcomes from a total of $n^k=6^4=1256$. $P(21) = 20/1256 = 0.015$

## The Birthday Problem
[What is the probability of at least 2 people in a group of *k* people having the same birthday?]{style="color: orange;"}

To answer this question, we can first approach the logic by answering some easier and more intuitive questions.  

::: {.incremental}
- [What is the probability of a shared birthday if $k = 366$?]{style="color: orange;"}
  + $P = 1$! Each person must be assigned to one of the $n = 365$ possible days of the year.
- [What is the probability that random person A has the same birthday as random person B?]{style="color: orange;"}
  +  $\frac{1}{365} = 0.0027$
- [What is the probability that person A has a *different* birthday than person B?]{style="color: orange;"}
  + $\frac{1}{365} = \frac{364}{365} = 0.9973$
  + Note that this is the complement of two random people sharing the same birthday. Therefore, this formula $1 - \frac{364}{365} = \frac{1}{365} = 0.0027$ can be used to calculate the probability of a shared birthday. 
:::

## How can we scale this logic to a group of *k*? 
::: {.incremental}
- [First, let's say $n = 3$. What is the probability of a shared birthday among 3 people?]{style="color: orange;"}
  + The complement of not sharing a birthday is the probability of a shared birthday. Therefore, this can be computed as: 
  $$P(3) = 1 - (\frac{364}{365})(\frac{363}{365}) = 0.008$$
  + This formula looks familiar... We have $n = 365$ possibilities for each *k* person, and we are calculating the probability of *not* sharing a birthday, as if we can pluck one date from the $n = 365$ and set it aside. [This is sampling without replacement.]{style="color: orange;"}
  
  + $365(365-1)(365-2)...(365-k+1)$ gives the number of ways to assign birthdays to *k* people for $ k \le 365$
  + To compute the probability, simply divide the above by the number of total possible outcomes, given by $365^k$, and subtract it from 1. $$ P(k) = 1 - \frac{365*364*363...*(365-k+1)}{365^k}$$

## Newton-Pepys problem
  
[Which of the following has the highest probability?]{style="color: orange;"}  
1. at least one 6 appears when 6 fair dice are rolled  
2. at least two 6's appear when 12 fair dice are rolled  
3. at least three 6's appear when 18 fair dice are rolled  

In the first scenario, we have $6^6$ total possible outcomes. We are interested in the subset E containing every event (each with probability $\frac{1}{6^6}$), where at least one die is a 6. 

::: {.incremental}
- This is hard to count, so we can instead compute $P(E) = 1 - E^c$. $E^c$ is where we do not get a single 6 on any of the $D_{n}$ dice. 
  + From the multiplication rule, we multiply the probabilities of each die *not* being a 6 together: $$P(E^c) = P(D_{1\neq6})*P(D_{2\neq6})*...P(D_{6\neq6}) = (\frac{5}{6})^6$$
  + Therefore, $$P(E) = 1 - (\frac{5}{6})^6 = 0.665$$ 
:::

## Alternate solution:
[Alternatively, we can think of this via a combinatorics approach as described in the text, where each die can take on 5 possible values (anything but 6).]{style="color: orange;"}   

- $E^c$ therefore has favorable outcomes of $5^6$. The probability is then given by dividing by the total number of possible outcomes, $6^6$. Therefore, $$P(E) = 1 - (\frac{5^6}{6^6}) = 0.665$$

[For 12 dice, we have to add the probability of choosing just one 6 from 12:]{style="color: orange;"}  
$$P(E) = 1 - \frac{5^{12} + \binom{12}{1}5^{11}}{6^{12}} = 0.62$$  

[For 18 dice, we have to add the probability of choosing just one 6 and just two 6's from 18:]{style="color: orange;"}  
$$P(E) = 1 - \frac{5^{18} + \binom{18}{1}5^{17} + \binom{18}{2}5^{16}}{6^{18}} = 0.60$$
